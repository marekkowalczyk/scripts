ls -lh gives human readable file sizes, long format.
ls -lhS sort by size, in human readable format
ls -lSrh listing everything in a directory order by file size (still human readable) ascending.

It uses k, M, G, and T suffixes (or no suffix for bytes) as needed so the number stays small, e.g. 1.4K or 178M.
