Example: Transform markdown sections to lowercase

Search:

^# (.+)$

Replace:

# \u\L$1\E

***

To uppercase or lowercase the next character in the replacement, use \u or \l. 

To affect a run of characters, surround them in \U...\E or \L...\E. 

For example, I can use the expression \b(?i:(james))\b to ﬁnd my ﬁrst name in any state of capitalization, and I can use this replacement \u\L$1\E string to ensure that it is title cased after the replacement.
