compress avi to vcd mpeg2

Video CDs are a quick and cheap way to watch a video from your computer on your TV. Converting a video file to VCD is very easy.

The command to use depends on your player format. Let's start with NTSC, the standard in North America:

ffmpeg -i original_video.avi -target ntsc-vcd final_video.mpg

The following is for PAL players, used mainly in Europe:

ffmpeg -i original_video.avi -target pal-vcd final_video.mpg
