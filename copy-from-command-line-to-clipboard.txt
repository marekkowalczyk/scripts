Use "pbcopy" to copy content of file to your clipboard.

For example:

$ pbcopy < file.txt
the command will copy all content from "file.txt" directly on your clipboard.

You can check if the content is there by using the "pbpaste" command:

$ pbpaste
The content of "file.txt" will appear on your terminal window.
