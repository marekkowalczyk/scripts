Detox is a utility designed to clean up filenames. It replaces difficult to work with characters, such as spaces, with standard equivalents. It will also clean up filenames with UTF-8 or Latin-1 (or CP-1252) characters in them.

For instance:

$ ls
Future Crew - Skaven - 2nd Reality.s3m
$ detox -v .

detox -s iso8859_1 -r -v -n /tmp/new_files

Will run the sequence iso8859_1 recursively, listing any changes, without changing anything, on the files of /tmp/new_files.

detox -s utf_8 -r -v ~/Downloads/

detox -s utf_8 -v *.pdf

detox -r -v -n /tmp/new_files

for file in *.pdf; do detox "$file"; done

for file in *; do detox "$file"; done
