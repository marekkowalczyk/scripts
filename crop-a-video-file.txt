crop a video file

Cropping is a very common operation in video editing. FFmpeg provides a *crop* filter for this specific purpose:

ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter:v "crop=out_w:out_h:x:y" output.mp4

The options are as follows:

- `out_w` is the width of the output rectangle
- `out_h` is the height of the output rectangle
- `x` and `y` specify the top left corner of the output rectangle
- `output.mp4` is the output file
