Please do note that this will overwrite files with the same name. That is, if there are two files that have otherwise identical filenames, but one has underscore(s) where the other has space(s). In that situation, the one that had underscores will be overwritten with the one that had spaces. This longer version will skip those cases instead:

for oldname in *
do
  newname=`echo $oldname | sed -e 's/ /_/g'`
  if [ "$newname" = "$oldname" ]
  then
    continue
  fi
  if [ -e "$newname" ]
  then
    echo Skipping "$oldname", because "$newname" exists
  else
    mv "$oldname" "$newname"
  fi
done
