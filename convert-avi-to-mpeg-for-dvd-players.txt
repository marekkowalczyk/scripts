convert avi to mpeg for dvd players

If you have a video you'd like to watch on a DVD player, here is how to properly encode it:

ffmpeg -i source_video.avi -target pal-dvd -ps 2000000000 -aspect 16:9 final_video.mpeg

Explanations:

- `target pal-dvd` : Output format
- `-ps 2000000000`: Maximum size for the output file, in bits (here, 2Gb)
- `-aspect 16:9`: Widescreen
