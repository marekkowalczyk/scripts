Listing buffers

The :buffers command lists the current buffers. There are two alternate names for this command :ls and :files. By default, only listed buffers will be displayed. Unlisted buffers can be included by appending !, for example :ls!.

Switching to another buffer

The command to switch to another buffer is :buffer, which is often abbreviated as :b, :bu or :buf. :buffer can be given either the name or the number of the buffer to edit.

Switching by name

When using the buffer name as the argument to :buffer, you don't have to specify the entire name. However, if more than one buffer matches the given argument then the buffers won't be switched.
